# march_madness

Last year I wrote down all 63 game choices for 27 brackets in my March Madness league. I want to automate the process going forward as much as possible using a webscraper. EPSN uses javascript so I'm still planning to download each .html for every bracket but once all downloaded I should be able to loop through them all and saves the results.
